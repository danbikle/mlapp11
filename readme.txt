readme.txt

This app should build a Machine Learning App which compares
effectiveness of GSPC predictions computed from Linear Regression and
Logistic Regression.

You should run the script, learn_test.bash to see the comparison.

Clone this repo with this shell command:

git clone https://github.com/danbikle/mlapp11

The scripts in this repo should work if you are on Linux and you have installed anaconda3.

The Anaconda download is at the URL listed below:

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

A download link I like:

https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.1.1-Linux-x86_64.sh

This should work:

/usr/bin/curl repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.1.1-Linux-x86_64.sh > ~/Anaconda3-4.1.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash ~/Anaconda3-4.1.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
