# learn_tst_rpt.py

# This script should learn from observations in /tmp/mlapp11/feat.csv

# Then it should test its learned models on observations later than the training observations.

# Next it should report effectiveness of the models.

# Demo:
# ~/anaconda3/bin/python genf.py TRAINSIZE=30 TESTYEAR=2015

# Above demo will train from years 1984 through 2014 and predict each day of 2015
